# node-homey-basicdriver

### Please do not use this library for production development, this is just a proof of concept and will be heavily subjected to changes

This library could theoretically be used as a base for node-homey-zwavedriver and possible future protocol specific drivers, or standalone to speed up app development for general apps.
